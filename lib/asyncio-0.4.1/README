Tulip is the codename for my reference implementation of PEP 3156.

The actual code lives in the 'asyncio' subdirectory.
Tests are in the 'tests' subdirectory.

To run tests:
  - make test

To run coverage (coverage package is required):
  - make coverage

On Windows, things are a little more complicated.  Assume 'P' is your
Python binary (for example C:\Python33\python.exe).

You must first build the _overlapped.pyd extension (it will be placed
in the asyncio directory):

    C> P setup.py build_ext

Then you can run the tests as follows:

    C> P runtests.py

And coverage as follows:

    C> P runtests.py --coverage
